  "parent_advice_content_3": "Giving children an interest rate is a way to teach how saving money works in adult life. The money that you save, well, they grow and become more money. Setting an interest rate in the piggy bank in order to teach this good conduct at an early age is good and is a knowledge that your children can take with them into adult life.",
  "parent_advice_title_4": "When should my children get their first bank card?",
  "parent_advice_content_4": "Giving a bank card to your child can be seen as a great step. Because all of a sudden your child can spend money without you parents' company. But if you provide them with a card, your children will also be able to make their own purchase decisions and be more responsible for their money. Only you as a parent can decide when this is appropriate, but many children nowadays get their bank card around 10 years of age.",
  "parent_advice_title_5": "How much should my child get as a weekly of monthly allowance?",
  "parent_advice_content_5": "It depends on what you agree that the child should use the money for. Make sure that it is enough for them to be able to buy what you have agreed on and a little bit more for saving. So you have set a solid basis. And don't forget, the most important thing isn't the amount they get, but how the money is spent and how the child learns to handle money. For this reason it is good to talk about different purchases, who pays for what and that you as parents make sure that the children get their money so that they can make their own purchase decisions.",
  "parent_advice_title_6": "How do we use the app if we are separated parents?",
  "parent_advice_content_6": "Gimi is developing features so that you as separated parents can be able to handle the child's money together. But right now the easiest thing to do is to set up an account for the child and agree on giving out a weekly allowance every week. The alternative is that the child sets up an account with each parent, and therefore has two accounts. But we understand that this is not perfect, so we are working on it!",
  "parent_advice_title_7": "What should I do when the child meets a savings goal?",
  "parent_advice_content_7": "It is important that you give out the money for the savings goal or that you, together with your child, buy the thing that the child was saving up for. In this way, the child's savings become real and the child learns that it pays off to save up for something that they really want to have!",
  "parent_advice_title_8": "Should I decide what the children should be able to buy with their money?",
  "parent_advice_content_8": "It is good to talk about what the weekly or monthly allowance should cover so that your children know what they should pay for themselves. But it is important that your children can decide what they will buy with their own money. So they can learn to make wrong purchases and learn from their mistakes, which is a good lesson for life!",
  "parent_advice_title_9": "What should my children get as an interest rate?",
  "parent_advice_content_9": "It depends on how you as a parent want to motivate them to saving. A child who has a hard time reaching the savings goal might need a little higher interest rate, while others might have a lower one if they are good at saving. But this is a good lesson that saved money grow, this is how it works when you grow up. He who saves, has!",
  "parent_advice_title_10": "How much should I reward my children when they complete chores?",
  "parent_advice_content_10": "You should try to adapt the amount you choose to give as a reward to how much money your child has, to how difficult the chore is and how important its completion is to you. But keep in mind that this is about lessons and that your child should be motivated to earn their own money and help out around the house. And don't forget, a hug or a thank you often mean more than a reward in money!",
  "parent_advice_title_11": "What does it mean that ”unpaid allowance is automatically saved”?",
  "parent_advice_content_11": "It is difficult to give out a weekly or monthly allowance in time and we don't always have money on us so that the children can get their money. If you choose that ”unpaid allowance” is automatically saved under settings, then the amount that wasn't paid in time is automatically put in the piggy bank. So the children get their weekly or monthly allowance in the piggy bank and you, instead, can give out the money when they must buy something. Then you can just choose to withdraw from the piggy bank!",
  "child_advice_title_1": "How can I get a higher weekly or monthly allowance?",
  "child_advice_content_1": "In order for you to get a higher weekly or monthly allowance, we have some smart tips here! 1. If you want to get a higher allowance, explain why and what you would do with the money. It isn't so smart to ask for an allowance raise to buy more candy, think instead about what good things you need money for, for example your bus card. 2. Negotiate at a good time. Don't do it when you have to buy something, but rather when you are at home at the dinner table. It is extra good if you negotiate when you have a birthday. Because when you become older you can ask for more money, because you can be more responsible. 3. The best way to get a raise is to ask your parents what you can help with or what you can do to earn some extra money. Ask your parents to insert it as a chore in the app, so that you really get the money when the chore is completed.",
  "child_advice_title_2": "What is an interest rate?",
  "child_advice_content_2": "Your interest rate is given in something called percent and it works so that when you save money you receive a savings bonus, just because you have saved your money. The more you have saved, the more you get as a bonus. And the higher the interest rate is, the more you get as a bonus too. So if you have gotten an interest rate from your parents and you save money, your saved money will grow!",
  "child_advice_title_3": "How does my piggy bank work?",
  "child_advice_content_3": "In your piggy bank you can save your money. You can, for example, save up your weekly allowance, when you get a reward for a chore or as a deposit that your parents can make. When you have bought something that your parents have paid for, you can take out the money from the piggy bank or if you want take out your money you can ask your parents for a payment, for example if you meet a savings goal and you want to take out your money to buy what you have been saving for.",
  "child_advice_title_4": "How does the weekly or monthly allowance that I will get work?",
  "child_advice_content_4": "Your weekly or monthly allowance is decided by your parents and you will receive it once per week or per month. You can choose to save your allowance in the piggy bank, but you can also ask your parents to pay it out in cash the day you have agreed on. Keep in mind that you don't get any savings bonus for the money in your allowance, so sometimes it can be smart to save it in the piggy bank even before you receive it.",
  "child_advice_title_5": "How do I get my money out from the app?",
  "child_advice_content_5": "You can ask your parents to give you your weekly or monthly allowance in cash. But you can also let your piggy bank work as your wallet, so when you and your parents are shopping you can use the money in the piggy bank by having your parents pay for you. So then they can take out the money from your piggy bank by making a withdraw in the app.",
  "child_advice_title_6": "Who can I connect with?",
  "child_advice_content_6": "You can just connect with your parents. This is so that no-one else can know how much money you have. You can connect with more than one parent. Just go to your settings and choose to invite one more parent.",
  "child_advice_title_7": "How do I accomplish a chore?",
  "child_advice_content_7": "Your parents assign chores to you. If you don't have any, you can ask for chores, and go on to discuss what you should do in order to complete the chores. When you have been assigned a chore, you can click on the chore to complete it. Keep in mind that some chores require you to give photo evidence, and some chores are on a  ”first come first served” basis so you must be faster than any of your siblings in completing it.",
  "child_advice_title_8": "Why should I set up a savings goal?",
  "child_advice_content_8": "It is always good to set up a goal for what you want to save up for. You can always change your savings goal along the way. But if you have a savings goal it is easier for you to see how your money grows and how you get closer to the amount you are saving up. When you meet the savings goal you should ask your parents to give you your money so that you can buy what you've been saving for!",
